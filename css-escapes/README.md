# [Mothereffing CSS escapes](http://mothereff.in/css-escapes)

Ever needed to escape a character in CSS? Ever used something like `<p class=123>` or even `<p id=/]o$o[\>` and got stuck trying to style it?

You can [learn how to do this yourself](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/html5-id-class#css), or just let Mothereffing CSS Escapes do all the work for you. Or both. Whatever.
